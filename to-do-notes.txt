* Cover actions could be more useful. The index just jumps to any next item in database.
  - Improvement: find next that has "BUY" status.
* After adding an item,
  - the whole list should be shown.
  - Auto-refresh, no explicit "refresh"
* How about incremental search + hide instead of delete?

* Removed the cover actions... put them back...


* Run-Time Errors:
DialogHeader.qml:
189: TypeError: Cannot read property 'backIndicatorDown' of null
242: TypeError: Cannot read property 'forwardIndicatorDown' of null

code:
>pageStack._pageStackIndicator.forwardIndicatorDown

>pageStack._pageStackIndicator.backIndicatorDown

REASON is obviously that _pageStackIndicator is null.

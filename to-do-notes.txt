  - Improvement: find next that has "BUY" status. CANCELLED v0.98: still no cover actions
* After adding an item,
  - the whole list should be shown. DONE v0.97
  - Auto-refresh, no explicit "refresh" DONE

* Run-Time Errors:
DialogHeader.qml:
189: TypeError: Cannot read property 'backIndicatorDown' of null
242: TypeError: Cannot read property 'forwardIndicatorDown' of null

code:
>pageStack._pageStackIndicator.forwardIndicatorDown

>pageStack._pageStackIndicator.backIndicatorDown

REASON is obviously that _pageStackIndicator is null.

>>PageStack.qml

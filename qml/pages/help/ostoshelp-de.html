<H1>How to use Ostos</h1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>
DEUTSCH
"Ostos" is a shopping list application. It has been handcrafted to the purpose over a quite long period,
analysing the natural flow of shopping, how I see it.
</p>
<p>
The app remembers what you have entered but doesn't tell anyone else!
No ads or shop chain connections... no connections at all at the moment.
I hope you enjoy it!
</p>
<H2>List page</H2>
<p>
The the first page that opens is the shopping list page, that shows
<p>

<br/>
The state can be toggled like by clicking the state icon on the left.

</ul>
<!-- The icon paths WERE:
/usr/share/themes/jolla-ambient/meegotouch/icons/
/usr/share/themes/jolla-ambient/meegotouch/z1.0/icons/ (for up and down)
The paths worked on emulator, but not on device.
Correct paths for device are:
/usr/share/themes/sailfish-default/meegotouch/z1.0/icons/
/usr/share/themes/sailfish-default/meegotouch/icons

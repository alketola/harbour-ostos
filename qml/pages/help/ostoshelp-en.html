<H1>How to use Ostos - Cart</h1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>
Ostos - you may call it "Cart" - is a shopping list application, that helps you plan and track your shopping.
It often helps you to avoid unnecessary typing, by offering the last bought items again.
Those you had hidden won't pop to the top of the list too often, but you can search them by name.
Ostos has been handcrafted to the purpose over months, analysing the natural flow of shopping.
</p>
<p>
The app remembers what you have entered but doesn't tell anyone else!
No ads or shop chain connections... no connections at all at the moment (except some help files are shown from from the web).
<br>
I hope you enjoy it!
</p>
<H2>List page</H2>
<p>
The the first page that opens is the shopping list page, that shows
<p>
Add new items by swiping to search page on the right, or by first item in the pulldown menu.
<br/>
The items have states, indicated by the icon on the left of each shopping list item.
<br/>
The state can be toggled like by clicking the state icon on the left.
<br/>
<ul>
<li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/graphic-toggle-on.png" /> <!--//<img src=\"../../images/graphic-toggle-on.png\" -->
The item is listed as to buy</li>
<li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/graphic-toggle-off.png" />The item has been bought</li>
<li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-s-task.png" />The item is listed as flagged</li>
</ul>
<p>An item can also be hidden but then it is not shown in the list</p>
</ul>
<p>
The context menu has options to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-m-dismiss.png" />hide</li>
  <li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-s-task.png" />flag</li>
  <li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-m-keyboard.png" />edit</li>
  <li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-m-up.png" />increase quantity</li>
  <li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-m-down.png" />decrease quantity</li>
  <li class="nobullet"><img src="../../images/icon-m-delete.png" />delete the item.</li>
</ul>
<!-- The icon paths WERE:
/usr/share/themes/jolla-ambient/meegotouch/icons/
/usr/share/themes/jolla-ambient/meegotouch/z1.0/icons/ (for up and down)
The paths worked on emulator, but not on device.
Correct paths for device are:
/usr/share/themes/sailfish-default/meegotouch/z1.0/icons/
/usr/share/themes/sailfish-default/meegotouch/icons
-->
<p>
Add new items by swithcing to search page on the right on first item in the pulldown menu
</p> 
<H2>Pulldown menu</H2>
<p>
There are options in Pulldown menu:
<ul>
  <li >Enter to buy - add items to list. Same as swipe left / next page</li>
  <li>Edit Shops - go to to the dialog page for adding shops</li>
  <li>Settings - go to settings page. Few settings.</li>  
  <li>Help - go to this page</li>
</ul>
</p>
<H2>Navigation</H2>
<p>
Swipe navigation is supported; swipe left to add items, dialogs go first to search page and 
then detail edit and confirmation of the item added to the list. Swipe right to go back.
</p> 
<H2>Search (Add) page</H2>
<p>
Type to the text field next to <img src="../../images/icon-m-search.png" />,
or pick your match from the shown list of buttons.
Accept with Accept or swipe left.
</p>
<H2>Edit page</H2>
<p>
The page shows item details retrieved from database, if any. The user should edit the values to his liking, and the press Accept or swipe left.
</p>
<h2>Edit shops page</h2>
<p>
The page is accessible from pulldown menu, where appropriate. A list of shop names is shown.
Each line can be pressed to show context menu, where Edit or Delete can be selected.
The names are edited in-place, so no further pages are opened.
Accept changes by forward navigation or Accept.
</p>
<H2>Settings Page</H2>
<p>
There are a couple of settings:
<ul>
<li>List refresh interval. The list takes some time to update, so this is the maximum time between ticking the status icons</li>
<li>Enable WWW help. Some of help files are stored with the application.
For possibly more up-to-date there is the app's help page on the web,
which helps you to get a Google translation for help.
Your operator may charge for data transfer.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A new shop name can be added with a pulldown menu command "Add new shop", which opens a dialog page.
Accept by forward navigation or Accept.
</p>
<h3>Shop list and the significiance of shop names</h3>
<p>
The shop names are used as shopping list filters on the List page.
The wildcard - * , star or asterisk will show all items on the list.
Each shopping list item has Shop property which can be selected from the Shop list.
The shops are added relatively infrequently, so the adding procedure is left a little bureaucratic,
so that accidential changes are not made too easily.
</p>
<h3>Database clearing and Uninstallation</h3>
<p>
The application uses Qt LocalStorage as the permanent storage in the device.
There is an option in Settings Pull-Down menu to clear the database tables.
If you do not clear the database, the data will persist and show up after reinstallation.
At the moment the database looks stable, so propably the database will be compatible after version upgrade.
There is no guarantee, however.
